# gnssdenied_flight_simulation
High fidelity flight simulation for an autonomous low SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) fixed wing unmanned air vehicle in GNSS-Denied conditions.

It is necessary to set four different global variables:
GIT_CONFIGURATION_PREFIX should point to the provided project_phd/phd/configuration folder.
GIT_INPUTS_PREFIX should point ot the provided project_phd/inputs folder.
GIT_OUTPUTS_PREFIX should point ot the provided project_phd/outputs folder.
GIT_OUTPUTS_STORE_PREFIX should also point ot the provided project_phd/outputs folder.

Matlab files are intended to visualize the trajectory results.

Big files containing preloaded turbulence values are required to obtain a trajectory. Please ask author through edugallo@yahoo.com if interested.
